# Bottom Sheet Example
Bottom sheets

A bottom sheet is a sheet of material that slides up from the bottom edge of the screen. Bottom sheets are displayed only as a result of a user-initiated action, and can be swiped up to reveal additional content. A bottom sheet can be a temporary modal surface or a persistent structural element of an app.
